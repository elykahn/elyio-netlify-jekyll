  There is nothing that will prepare you for sudden and complete loneliness, an
  abrupt shift from having someone there, not everyday but sometimes(enough to
  look forward to and enjoy), someone that really gets you, or says she does,
  who completely changes your outlook on life and makes your days brighter and
  more hopeful, your nights cooler and more intimate, all ending in an abrupt
  and really predictable abandonment at 100%, because when giving a couple of
  hours of your time each week to the company of a loving boy toy, the only way
  to make it easier for you is to bail completely and tell yourself that it's
  not your responsibility to act sensitively towards him, completely failing to
  appreciate the hundreds of thoughtful and selflessly made decisions that he's
  done that made him vulnerable and an easy target for destruction. He doesn't
  act like most guys, I guess med school students are like most guys and that
  for all their declarations, women actually prefer that men keep their emotions
  to themselves(or, rather, use them as a weapon against the vulnerable man
  himself).
